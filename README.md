homebrew-experimental
=====================

Experimental formulæ for Homebrew (the missing OS X package manager)

About
-----

This is a ["tap"](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/brew-tap) for
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulæ I'm developing.  Some are new creations,
while others are experimental changes to existing formulæ.  All should be
considered _highly_ experimental, so use at your own risk.

Do feel free to use them, though. You can do that in the usual way:

    brew tap L2G/experimental

Please let me know if you have comments, suggestions, etc.


Highlights
----------

These formulæ are more stable than the others, and I use them
regularly myself:
