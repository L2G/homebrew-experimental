============

Experimental formulæ for Homebrew (the missing OS X package manager)

About
-----

This is a "tap" for formulæ I'm writing for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
They should be considered highly experimental, so use at your own risk.

Do feel free to use them, though. You can do that in the usual way:

    brew tap l2g/l2g

Please let me know if you have comments, suggestions, etc.
